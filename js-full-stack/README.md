# Javascript Full Stack Todo List Exercise

First off, thank you for both your time and your interest in Tonic! Please create a single-page todo list application. We prefer you time box this exercise to approximately 3&ndash;3.5 hours, and is not expected to be perfect. Most importantly, it should demonstrate your skill set, and give us a better idea of how you approach problems and construct solutions.

Feel free to use any resources that you would normally have at your disposal (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.), and do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com) if you have any questions.

## Minimum Requirements

There are no specific requirements about how you build the app. At a minimum, however, your application should fulfill the following:

- Use React or NextJS for the FrontEnd
- Use a CSS framework of your choice
- Use a CSS convention of your choice (Preprocessors, Modules, CSS-in-JS, etc.)
- Implement all CRUD actions
- Implement routing

- Implement a Node/Express Backend
- Setup a few CRUD routes/endpoints for the app
- No need for a datastore, you can just echo back static results

## Bonus Points

- Add a persistence layer
- Deploy the application

## Submission Guidelines

Please create a new repository on GitHub and send us a link. Do not fork this repository. Alternatively, you may send us an archive by [email](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com).
