# Full-Stack TypeScript Todo List Exercise

Thank you for your interest in Tonic! As part of our process, we’d like you to complete a short full-stack coding exercise. The goal is to understand how you approach problems, organize your code, and deliver features across the stack.

Pleasae time-box your effort to **3–3.5 hours**. We’re not looking for perfection—just a thoughtful, working solution that reflects how you build software.

Please include details in the README for setting up and running your project locally.

You can use AI for research, but please do not use it to generate code within the project.

Set your project up as a GIT repository, create an initial commit when you start the project and a final commit when you complete.

Please forward the GIT repo as your handoff, feel free to add any additional details or color with an additioanl email. 


Feel free to use any resources you normally rely on (e.g., Google, Stack Overflow, documentation). 
If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us.

## Project Overview

Build a single-page **Todo List** application with a backend that supports basic data operations. The app should allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. We expect you to demonstrate proficiency in both front-end and back-end JavaScript, including the use of **TypeScript**, **React**, **CSS**, and server-side logic running in a **Node.js environment** (e.g., Express or Next.js API routes).

---

## Requirements

Your application should meet the following baseline criteria:

### Frontend

- Use **React** (preferred) or **Angular** with **TypeScript**
- Implement **routing** (client-side or file-based)
- Implement full **CRUD functionality**
- Build a clean, usable UI using **CSS** (with or without a framework)

### Backend

- Use **TypeScript** to implement server-side logic in a **Node.js environment**
- Expose basic **API endpoints** for managing todos
- Include a **persistence layer** (in-memory, file-based, or database-backed)

## Submission

Please submit your work the following way:

- Push to a new **GitHub repository** and share the link
