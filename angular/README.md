# Angular Todo List Exercise

Please create a single-page todo list application. This exercise should take approximately 1&ndash;2 hours, and is not expected to be perfect. Most importantly, it should demonstrate your skill set, and give us a better idea of how you approach problems and construct solutions.

Feel free to use any resources that you would normally have at your disposal (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.), and do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com) if you have any questions.

## Minimum Requirements

There are no specific requirements about how you build the app. At a minimum, however, your application should fulfill the following:

* Use Angular version 2 or greater and TypeScript
* Use a CSS framework of your choice
* Implement all CRUD actions

## Bonus Points

* Add a persistence layer
* Create a build process

## Submission Guidelines

Please create a new repository on GitHub and send us a link. Do not fork this repository. Alternatively, you may send us an archive by [email](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com).
