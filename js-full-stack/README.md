# Full-Stack TypeScript Todo List Exercise

Thank you for your interest in Tonic! As part of our process, we’d like you to complete a short full-stack coding exercise. The goal is to understand how you approach problems, organize your code, and deliver features across the stack.

We recommend time-boxing your effort to **3–3.5 hours**. We’re not looking for perfection—just a thoughtful, working solution that reflects how you build software.

Feel free to use any resources you normally rely on (e.g., Google, Stack Overflow, documentation). If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us.

## Project Overview

Build a single-page **Todo List** application with a backend that supports basic data operations. The app should allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. We expect you to demonstrate proficiency in both front-end and back-end JavaScript, including the use of **TypeScript**, **React**, **CSS**, and server-side logic running in a **Node.js environment** (e.g., Express or Next.js API routes).

## Requirements

Your application should meet the following baseline criteria:

### Frontend

- Use **React** with **TypeScript**
- Implement **routing** (client-side or file-based)
- Implement full **CRUD functionality**
- Build a clean, usable UI using **CSS** (with or without a framework)

### Backend

- Use **TypeScript** to implement server-side logic in a **Node.js environment**
- Expose basic **API endpoints** for managing todos
- Include a **persistence layer** (in-memory, file-based, or database-backed)

## Submission

Please submit your work in one of the following ways:

- Push to a new **GitHub repository** and share the link
- Email a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive
