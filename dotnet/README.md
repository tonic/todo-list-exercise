# .NET Todo List Exercise

Please create a database and a web-based .NET API for a simple todo list application. This exercise should take approximately 1&ndash;2 hours, and is not expected to be perfect. Most importantly, it should demonstrate your skill set, and give us a better idea of how you approach problems and construct solutions.

Feel free to use any resources that you would normally have at your disposal (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.), and do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com) if you have any questions.

## Minimum Requirements

There are no specific requirements about how you build the app, model your data, or implement the API. At a minimum, however, your application should fulfill the following:

* Use C# and .NET
* Create a database
* Implement all RESTful CRUD actions in a API controller

## Bonus Points

* Utilize your favorite dependency injection framework
* Utilize an ORM of your choice
* Use the repository pattern

## Submission Guidelines

Please create a new repository on GitHub and send us a link. Do not fork this repository. Alternatively, you may send us an archive by [email](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com).
